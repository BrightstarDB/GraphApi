BrightstarDB Graph API
----------------------

BrightstarDB is an RDF and thus inherently a graph data store. It currently provides LINQ and SPARQL as ways to navigate and query the data. This API provides a way to traverse the graph using a set of operators that are similar to traditional graph navigation. 

An example is:

From(X).Traverse("worksfor").Filter("name = BrightstarDB").Select("Location");

Note: This API is under development and experimental at this time.
